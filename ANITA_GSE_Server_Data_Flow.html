<h1>ANITA GSE SERVER INTERNAL DATA FLOW</h1>
Predrag Miocinovic, last updated 10/02/2006<br>
<br>
This document outlines what happens to telemetry data once it reaches
Anita <a
 href="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/%7Epredrag/post/anita/software/gse-setup.html">GSE
server</a>. It is intended to be technical document to help with
maintaining and modifying the server, not as a user documentation. Any
files and utilities not explicitly defined as coming from an external
package are to be assumed a part of <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">anitagse</span> package.<br>

<h2><a name="Server_Layout"></a>Server Layout</h2>
Running of an ANITA GSE server is based on collection of shell scripts
that controls how incoming data is stored and processed. These scripts
are just wrappers for underlying processes, which themselves are either
shell or Perl scripts, or C/C++ executables. All top level scripts are
generated automatically during GSE server configuration (by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gseconf</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol setup</span>) and are
controlled by <a href="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools.html">daemontools</a>
utilities which ensure that they continually run and that their outputs
are logged. The incoming telemetry is processed in three steps;<br>
<ol>
  <li>Incoming data is received and redistributed&nbsp; (if server
configured to do so)</li>
  <li>Data files are untarred and linked for processing</li>
  <li>Each file is sent to unpacking daemon which parses telemetry
packets and stores telemetry into database or files (or both)</li>
</ol>
These steps are addressed in the rest of this document. The performance
of GSE server (i.e. is it keeping up with the data flow) can be
monitored through with an HTML utility described in the last section. <br>
<br>
Performing GSE configuration (<span style="font-family: monospace;">gseconf</span>)
and setup (<span style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol setup</span>)
will produce subdirectories <span style="font-family: monospace;">services/</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">active_services/</span> in
the top level anitagse directory, and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">svscan</span> process (part of
daemontools) will be activated on <span style="font-family: monospace;">active_services</span>
subdirectory. Subdirectory <span style="font-family: monospace;">services</span>
contains additional subdirectories with top level scripts for each
process that is a part of GSE server. When <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol run n</span> is executed,
appropriate links will be made in active_services subdirectory to
elements of services subdirectory. On <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol stop</span>, these links
will be removed. On <span style="font-family: monospace;">gse terminate</span>,
services subdirectory will be removed and svscan process stopped. On <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol prime</span>, svscan will
be activated.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span>: In the <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">anitagse</span> package there are
actually two <span style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol</span>
scripts. The first is <span style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol_single</span>
which will be used on single CPU/core machine and the other is <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol_smp</span> which will be
used on multi CPU/core machine. The CPU determination is made by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gseconf</span> script and appropriate <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol</span> script is linked.
The difference between the two is that smp version will run two
parallel unpacking daemons for LOS telemetry, one for odd numbered
files the other for even numbered files in order to increase telemetry
processing throughput. <br>
This is a kludge solution, since I was unable to find a way to
configure PostgreSQL sever and Linux kernel in such way that more CPU
resources are given to single unpacking process. Running only one
unpacking process on multi core machine left more that 50% of CPU
cycles idle. It was not disk I/O issues since running two processes in
parallel raised CPU usage to +80%. I suspect its kernel resource
allocation issue, but I wasn't able to resolve it. If someone has an
idea, it would great.<br>
<br>
<h2><a name="Receiving_and_redistributing_data"></a>Receiving and
redistributing data</h2>
The GSE server listens for incoming connection on port 7740 (by
default,
although this is configurable in <span style="font-family: monospace;">gseconf</span>
script) via <span style="font-family: monospace;">tcpserver</span>
utility which is a part of <a href="http://cr.yp.to/ucspi-tcp.html">ucisp-tcp</a>
package. Data received through this port is passed on to <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">tcp/receive_data.pl</span> script
which will;<br>
<ol>
  <li>Store a copy of incoming data stream (if instructed to
redistribute data)</li>
  <li>Untar data stream (it expects that incoming data was generated by
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">'tar cf -'</span>); top
directory specified in <span style="font-family: monospace;">gseconf</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Pass the content list of the tarball to pipe <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">tcp/filenames</span> (generated during
    <span style="font-family: monospace;">gsecontrol run</span>)</li>
  <li>Spawn a child process which will send buffered copy of data
stream to another IP address on port 7740&nbsp; (if instructed to
redistribute data)</li>
  <li>Remove buffered copy of data stream once all children processes
exit (on either success or failure, i.e. redistribution is not
attempted again on failure) <br>
  </li>
</ol>
This receiving data script has been proven to be very robust and was
used since ANITA-lite campaign with minimal changes.<br>
<h2><a name="Queuing_incoming_files"></a>Queuing incoming files</h2>
Queuing incoming data files of processing is performed by two scripts <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">tcp/process_data.pl</span>
and <span style="font-family: monospace;">clearlink.pl</span>. The
first one takes data file names from <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">tcp/filename</span> pipe, makes unique<br>
link name, and places that link to GSE link directory. The second
script manages content of this link directory. If it finds a link older
than some amount (5-10 minutes is optimal amount, configurable in
gseconf), it moves it to subdirectory <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">old/</span>. If it finds no links in
the link directory and "resurrects" an older link from <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">old/</span> subdirectory (if any
exist) and places it in link directory. This way links in the link
directory will never be too old, ensuring that fresh telemetry gets
processed first and any older files get processed only if there is
spare CPU capacity.&nbsp; Ideally, GSE server should always be able to
handle incoming telemetry
at LOS rates, but sometimes due to high GUI user load it could fall
behind. It is very useful to monitor PostgreSQL server performance via <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">'top -c -u postgres'</span> or via <a
 href="#Monitoring_server_performance">HTML interface</a>.<br>
<h2><a name="Unpacking_daemons"></a>Unpacking daemons</h2>
Unpacking daemons are in charge of parsing telemetry data stream and
extracting ANITA data from it. The daemon <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">unpackd</span> is C++ process (source
in <span style="font-family: monospace;">unpack/</span> subdirectory)
which
relies on <a href="http://cosray.wustl.edu/%7Emarty/lddl/doc-1.8a.html">lddl</a>
library to extract science portion of telemetry. The science data is
then scanned and each science data structure is reconstituted. At this
point unpacker will do several things:<br>
<ol>
  <li>If instructed to <a href="#Storing_to_database">store to database</a>,
it will prepare science data for insertion into database by generating
an ascii SQL command and will transmit that command to PostgreSQL
server via <a
 href="http://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/static/libpq.html"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">libpq</span></a> library call.</li>
  <ul>
    <li>On insertion failure, the failed ascii SQL command will be
logged. The failures will most likely occur for data with telemetry
errors since database guards itself from storing information which
could have detrimental effect on it self-consistency. E.g: (this was
actually observed) a waveform packet showed up which had chipId
garbled, value was 191, and was thus rejected. However, a garbled SCA
value would not be rejected. Very rarely, a valid SQL insertion command
will fail, in which case it can be manually inserted into the database.
I sometimes do following <span style="font-family: monospace;">'grep
INSERT &lt;log file name&gt; | psql &lt;db name&gt;'</span>, which will
try to pass all logged SQL insertion failures to database again. The
output of <span style="font-family: monospace;">psql</span> will
provide info on which commands are rejected again and why. <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>If instructed to <a href="#Storing_to_files">store to files</a>,
the data structure will be sent to file handling module which tries to
replicate data storage onboard flight computer.</li>
  <li>The data structure type and size will be logged. The summery of
processing is found in files <span style="font-family: monospace;">'/tmp/anita_monitor_*'</span>
where <span style="font-family: monospace;">'*'</span> uniquely
identifies telemetry data stream:</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">los</span> for LOS
telemetry (on multi CPU machine, there will be <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">los_odd</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">los_even</span>, instead)</li>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">sip_hr</span> for high
rate TDRSS telemetry <br>
    </li>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">sip_lr</span> for
combined low rate TDRSS and Iridium telemetry<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Several critical pieces of telemetry data are extracted and
stored in a temporary files;</li>
  <ul>
    <li>GPS location; stored in<span style="font-family: monospace;">
/tmp/anita_gpsloc.txt</span> in format <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">UNIX_UTC TimeOfDay Latitude Longitude
Altitude</span></li>
    <li>GPS orientation; stored in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/tmp/anita_gpsorient.txt</span> in
format <span style="font-family: monospace;">UNIX_UTC Heading Pitch
Roll</span></li>
    <li>Critical HK values; stored in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">/tmp/anita_hkcrit.txt</span> in format
      <span style="font-family: monospace;">UNIX_UTC Battery_Current
PV_Voltage CPU_temp Radiator_Plate_Temp</span></li>
    <li>Command echo; stored in <span style="font-family: monospace;">/tmp/anita_cmdecho.txt</span>
in format <span style="font-family: monospace;">UNIX_UTC
Good_Flag Command Bytes (first in hex, the rest in decimal)</span></li>
  </ul>
</ol>
There will be one unpacking daemon running per telemetry encoding type
(actually, on multi CPU machine, two daemons will handle LOS telemetry)
since lddl engine needs unique format specifier. Note that version
lddl-1.8b is required since data is passed to lddl through a pipe which
sometimes has no data in it. Version 1.8a would close such pipe and
exit, but 1.8b will wait for data to appear again without exiting. Each
daemon monitors a pipe named <span style="font-family: monospace;">'/tmp/unpackd_fifo_*'</span>
where <span style="font-family: monospace;">'*'</span> is
corresponding telemetry format name; <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">los </span>(<span
 style="font-family: monospace;">los_odd</span> and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">los_even</span> on multi CPU machine),
<span style="font-family: monospace;">sip_hr</span>, and <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">sip_lr</span>.<br>
<h2><a name="Storing_to_files"></a>Storing to files</h2>
When outputting data to files, unpacking daemon's file handling module
will place files in a directory structure resembling one used on the
flight computer. The top directory is named in gseconf, and
subdirectories will be:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">event</span> - contains
header and waveform files<br>
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>Headers are packed 100 to a file, with filename given by first
event in the file<br>
    </li>
    <li>Waveforms are packed 81 to a file, one file per event. This is
different than on the flight computer since there is no way to tell
which events would be in a file if there is more than one. The format
is always 81 consecutive structures of type <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">RawWaveformPacket_t</span> or <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">PedSubbedWaveformPacket_t</span>. <br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">house</span> - contains
subdirectories cmd,&nbsp; gps,&nbsp; hk,&nbsp; monitor,&nbsp;
surfhk,&nbsp; turfhk</li>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">cmd</span> - contains
command echoes, 1000 per file</li>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">gps</span> - contains
subdirectories adu5 and g12</li>
    <ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">adu5</span> - contains
subdirectories pat, sat, and vtg</li>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">pat</span> - contains
adu5 pat structures, 1000 per file</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">sat</span> - contains
adu5 sat structures, 1000 per file</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">vtg</span> - contains
adu5 vtg structures, 1000 per file</li>
      </ul>
      <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">g12</span> - contains
pos and sat subdirectories</li>
      <ul>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">pos</span> - contains
g12 pos structures, 1000 per file</li>
        <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">sat</span> - contains
g12 sat structures, 1000 per file</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">hk</span> - contains raw
housekeeping structures, 1000 per file, and calibration housekeeping
structures, 2 per file<br>
      <span style="font-family: monospace;"></span></li>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">monitor</span> - contains
monitor structures, 1000 per file</li>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">surfhk</span> - contains
SURF housekeeping structures, 1000 per file</li>
    <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">turfhk</span> - contains
TURF rate structures, 1000 per file</li>
  </ul>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">pedestal</span> - contains
pedestal structures in format readable by AnitaViewer GUI</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: monospace;">config</span> - contains
configuration and log file dumps</li>
</ul>
In each directory that stores multiple structures per file, there is a
special file <span style="font-family: monospace;">current</span>
which names currently incomplete file and number of structures already
in that file. This file is only written out when <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">unpackd</span> exists. <br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NB:</span>
There might arise a problem with this scheme since there will be a lot
of waveforms arriving and storing a lot of files in one directory
causes some system strain. A scheme which would place waveforms in
subdirectories should be devised.<br>
</div>
<br>
<h2><a name="Storing_to_database"></a>Storing to database</h2>
The database used to store ANITA telemetry is defined in file <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">create_tables.sql</span>. The tables
and their variables are listed <a
 href="http://www.phys.hawaii.edu/%7Epredrag/post/anita/gse_programs/AnitaDatabaseLayout.html">here</a>.
In addition to defining tables, this file creates table indicies,
notifications, views, and triggers. Also, it defines trigger procedures
which are used to calibrate housekeeping and waveform data. All other
data, i.e. packets that don't require calibration, are just transcribed
from C structure into database table representation with few additional
fields, like checksum check and the time of processing. Housekeeping
and waveform packets, in addition to raw values, also have their
calibrated values stored in database tables. The calibration is
performed at the point of insertion to the database. Sometimes
waveforms can not be calibrated if their header has not arrived, so
they will be calibrated once that header shows up. <br>
<h2><a name="Monitoring_server_performance"></a>Monitoring server
performance</h2>
There are three main things that have to be monitored on a GSE server,
and all three are available through HTML interface in <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">html/</span> subdirectory or just by
invoking shell commands. They are;<br>
<ul>
  <li>Number of links in the link directory; ideally there should be
just links for files currently being processed.&nbsp; If links are
accumulating, the server must be doing something that prevents it from
processing telemetry with sufficient resources.</li>
  <li>Monitor files in <span style="font-family: monospace;">/tmp</span>
directory; key statistics are current and average rates. The average
rate should be at average rate of telemetry, while current rate should
be higher than this indicating that once data is present is being
processed with room to spare.</li>
  <li>CPU usage; in <span style="font-family: monospace;">top</span>
one should monitor amount of CPU time used by <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">postmaster</span> processes which are
part of PostgreSQL server. If there is spare CPU capacity, but links
are accumulating, there is a problem somewhere. In such case, keep an
eye on incoming GUI connections to the database. They can be identified
if you run <span style="font-family: monospace;">'top -c -u postgres'</span>
and widen shell window with top to see full process command line.
Incoming connection will be marked with IP address and word <span
 style="font-family: monospace;">gui</span>. <br>
