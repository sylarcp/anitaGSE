This directory contains scripts needed to receive Anita data stream, fan it 
out as necessary, unpack and create links for processing by GSE software. 
 
Before running anything, run ./gseconf in to GSE directory (after editing
it!). That will create 'receive.sh' script in this directory. 
Perl script receive_data.pl is called by receive.sh to store data received 
through TCP and to fan it out as needed. The list of files received will 
be piped to a filehandle as specified by configure. Perl script 
process_data.pl reads the filenames from the filehandle and makes links to 
those files for use by subsequent GSE daemons. 

You shouldn't need to control these scripts directly. Everything should be 
done by 'gsecontrol' script in the top directory. See top directory README.
