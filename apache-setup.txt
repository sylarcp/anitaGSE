Configuring Apache 
-----------------

Apache default configuration is rather paranoid and constricting. 
You will need to;

* Allow Apache to access and execute CGI scripts in GSE html directory
* Allow Apache to follow sym links

To do so, you need to add something like following to httpd.conf
-----
<Directory /home/*/public_html>
        Options Indexes ExecCGI FollowSymLinks MultiViews
        AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .pl
        AllowOverride None
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
</Directory>
-------

Here I allow use of "http://host/~user" type web spaces (also needs to be 
uncommented in default httpd.conf). 
Next, you should have /home/user/public_html path have 755 privelages (or at 
least 711 above public_html). 

Also, on FC versions of RedHat SElinux security policy is enforced on httpd. 
This turned out to be a royal pain, and I completely disabled it for httpd 
through GUI on my desktop menus. Also, there is SUexec protection on apache 
(another pain if you ask me), and to get rid of it do;
* locate suexec
* mv /my/path/suexec /my/path/suexec_disabled

Hopefully, that should do it. Restart apache. To test, put following as
hello.cgi into /home/user/public_html (and chmod to a+x)
-----------
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;

sub timestr {
  my ($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$ydaym,$isdst)=@_;
  my $str=sprintf "%4d-%02d-%02d %s %02d:%02d:%02d",($year+1900,$mon+1,$mday,(qw
(Sun Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat))[$wday],$hour,$min,$sec);
  return $str;
}

my $refrate=2;
my $host=`hostname`;
my $gmt=timestr(gmtime(time));
print <<HTML;
Content-Type: text/html
Refresh: $refrate

<html>
<body>
<center>
Hello world!<br>
It's $gmt @ $host<br>
</center>
</body>
</html>
HTML
---------------

Point your browser to http://localhost/~user/hello.cgi
You should see the hello message refreshing every 2 seconds. 

If you get some error, look through access_log and error_log that apache keeps
(likely in /var/log/httpd) for clues to what went wrong.
